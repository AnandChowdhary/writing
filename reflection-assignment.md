#### One ancient example of disruptive tech

- The use of the bow and arrow, and gunpowder in later centuries are instances of how the adoption of a disruptive technology and its innovative application had decisively impacted the creation of new empires and kingdoms.
- "Babylonian machine planter"

#### The three recent revolutions, dates and eventualities

- The first industrial revolution (1765 –) used water and steam to mechanise production, the second (1870 –) used electric energy to create mass production and the third (1969 –) used electronics and information technology to automate production

#### What characterizes the fourth revolution in the "present scenario"

- "Now a fourth industrial revolution is underway which builds upon the third revolution, and the digital revolution that has been taking place since the middle of the last century. This fourth revolution is powered by the emergence of the INTERNET and DIGITALISATION and characterises technology that blurs the lines between the physical, digital and biological spheres to disrupt industries all over the world."

#### List 4th revolution disruptive technologies. At what does industry aim?

- "Industry of today and tomorrow aim to connect all production means to enable their interaction in real time. Communication and coordination among the different players and connected objects in a production line will become possible thanks to technology such as Cloud, Big Data Analytics, Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things. Factories of tomorrow will be increasingly embedded in Smart Cities. It may not be long before these changes extend to semi-urban centres and villages as well."
- "Industrial Robots will work in three shifts, seven days a week without any unionisation and industrial relations problems. These robots will replace manpower at many levels."
- "Advances in software, especially machine-learning, deep learning and neural networks, are key enablers of knowledge work automation. This Artificial Intelligence will lead to the elimination of many routine white collar jobs."
- The Energy Sector is witnessing far-reaching changes. Renewable Energy comprising of Solar Power and Wind Power is already competing with energy from fossil fuels with dramatic additions to capacity globally and falling prices.

#### Education - describe advances and projected disruptions

- "The education sector will be highly impacted by the developments in disruptive Information and Communications Technologies, and corresponding innovative changes in pedagogy. In the near future, traditional college and university education connected with high income generating professional courses like science, engineering and management studies may well lose its primacy."
- "Many mediocre and economically weaker students may prefer to enrol for cheaper online distance courses leaving only the meritorious and well-off students to pursue the expensive higher education delivered by brick and mortar colleges and universities."

#### Robotics - describe advances and projected disruptions

- "Robots will be more sophisticated – with enhanced ‘senses’, dexterity, and intelligence – and will be capable of doing intricate jobs."
- "Industrial Robots will work in three shifts, seven days a week without any unionisation and industrial relations problems. These robots will replace manpower at many levels."
- "Companies which use such robots in large numbers will produce goods and services at very competitive rates and are likely to adversely impact traditional manufacturers leading to significant job losses."

#### 3D printers - describe advances and projected disruptions

- "Innovative 3D printers will make forging, die-casting, lathe turning, drilling, broaching, brick laying (for building, construction), RCC work, etc., partially or completely redundant. Mechanical Engineering and Civil Engineering education of the future will not deal with most of the traditional syllabus covered today"
- "Many household products, toys, decorative items, etc. will be made in the home itself using 3D printers – there will be no need to go to the market"

#### What will be required due to the displacement of human workers; and, if the projections of this paper are correct, then we will need more of which kinds of activities? By implication, which sorts of skills may be most beneficial?

- "These online businesses will generate huge job requirements across diverse functions like logistics, warehousing, etc. and spur business growth worldwide that may partially offset the job losses in the brick and mortar retail sector."

#### Future concerns? Describe.

- "With the exponential growth of Digitalisation and Internet technologies, Cyber Security is emerging as a very serious concern the world over. Recent instances of Hacking and Virus infection have already shown how vulnerable even the most developed countries are to these threats."
- "A new brand of terrorism – Cyber Terrorism – is on the rise and cannot be ignored. New tools will be needed to preserve the security of international data networks."

The following are quotes from "Sustainability: The search for the integral worldview", available at https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016328711001340#sec0035 and cited as:

> N. D. van Egmond and H. J. M. de Vries, "Sustainability: The search for the integral worldview," Futures, vol. 43, no. 8, pp. 853–867, 2011, doi: 10.1016/j.futures.2011.05.027.

#### How may we view history? Explain "limits to growth" in this context. What are the causes of unsustainability? What has failed to reach popular awareness?

- "Human history can be seen as a sequence of disruptive discontinuities or punctuated equilibriums, depending on whether the emphasis is on change or stasis. Change happens at an ever increasing scale and rate. Local and regional civilizations and the qualities of life they had developed for their citizens could not be sustained."
- "As was explored for the first time with a computer simulation model in the report Limits to Growth to the Club of Rome, the scale of these processes of change is now approaching the scale of the planet. Moreover, their rate of change is still exponential: population, industrial output, resource use and pollutant emission keep growing and may well overshoot the earth carrying capacity."
- "It linked environmental (un)sustainability to both the overconsumption by the rich populations and poverty-driven overexploitation by the poor populations."
- "Apparently, the call for a 'sustainable development' in both reports did so far not result in sufficiently effective changes in population growth, resource use and technological developments to avoid the serious negative impacts for which both reports warned."
- "The discussion about human needs, as raised by the Brundtland Commission, so far did not result in public awareness, let alone national or global policies."
- "Not only does it confirm the conclusion of the Commission that the solutions of the sustainability problem has to be found in human needs and value orientations, but also it concludes that the ongoing trends to un-sustainability result from recurring and predictable imbalances in the societal value orientations and the related visions on the quality of life."

#### Define "sustainable development" and explain what it must deliver in terms of "quality of life".

- "The Brundtland Commission defined sustainable development as "development that meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.""
- "In first instance, one would associate a good quality of life with the extent to which people can function according to their value orientation. However, a person's experience of a good quality of life is often equally or more dependent on the available options, i.e., on the capabilities, than on the actual realization of these options."
- "Sen therefore proposes to define quality of life on the basis of capabilities rather than on functionings. Given the fact that the capabilities are constrained, for example by environmental or economic factors, the subjective 'quality of life' concept can be connected to the more objective environmental and resource aspect, which in turn is the result of social interactions."

#### What "enigmatic question" are the authors trying to solve and how do they propose to do it?

- "Following this line of thought, sustainable development in the Brundtland definition is seen as the continuation of a certain set of capabilities, depending on a person's value orientation, as part of his or her individual perception of 'the good life'"
- "On the other hand the realization of the required capabilities might be constrained by environmental factors or resource scarcity."
- "The Brundtland Commission apparently assumes (inter-generational) equity between present and future generations and this raises the paradoxical question which needs are equally valued by future as well as present generations, and at the same time can be realized within the increasing constraints on the physical capabilities"
- "In order to solve this enigmatic question, the relation between the human value orientations and the corresponding capabilities should be understood." 

#### Explain the relationship between value orientation and capability.

- "Value orientations and capabilities can be seen as two parallel levels, which are depicted in Fig. 1 as two parallel 2-dimensional planes. Which capabilities in the lower plane are to be realized depends on the choices made, and thus positions taken in the upper plane."
- "The dependency of the (choice for) capabilities from the value orientations goes further than the straightforward end-means relation. Different value orientations imply also different views on the relevance of certain capabilities and their mutual relations and interactions."
 - "In practice affinity to specific value orientations (quality of life ends) will coincide with affinity to specific beliefs about how to achieve these ends by quality of life means."
 - "Apparently value orientations have a twofold role; to value what is worthwhile with respect to quality of life and, secondly, how to interpret the role and meaning of capabilities therein."

#### Distinguish between predictive and descriptive assumptions. What do these "encompass"?

- "prescriptive assumptions refer to value orientations, to the question about the importance of certain things and themes over others. They are subjective and refer to a certain, chosen quality of life and are represented by the upper plane in Fig. 1;"
- "descriptive assumptions refer to the belief system about how the world functions, to mental maps of how things work. They usually have a more shared, objective nature and frame the way in which the chosen quality of life can be reached or maintained by the capabilities represented by the lower plane in Fig. 1."

#### What are "worldviews"?

- "A worldview is thus defined as a combination of a person's value orientation and his or her view on how to understand the world and the capabilities it offers, the lens through which the world is seen."
- "There are several ways to acquire knowledge about peoples worldviews: (1) social surveys among present day people (2) psychological and philosophical insights gained over the last millennia (3) notions from cultures and religions (4) empirical observations and experiences in the ‘laboratory’ of human history."

#### Account for this picture: (picture captioned "major value orientations in the population)

- "The original distribution of value orientations is multi-dimensional. In first instance for practical reasons, this multi-dimensional data set is reduced by a principal component analysis to the two dimensions which are statistically the most relevant ones and which constitute the 2-dimensional plane of drawing in Fig. 2."
- "The figure suggests that the multidimensional ‘value space’ can be statistically meaningful reduced to two main dimensions: the contrast giving (upper) versus taking (lower) and the contrast small world (right) versus big-world (left)."
- "The first component along the vertical axis is very close to the contrast religious versus worldly and im-materialistic versus materialistic. The second component on the horizontal axis can be associated with an orientation on the own local community versus the world as a whole or, from a more individual stance as the contrast between self and the other(s) and between individual and collective."
- "After projection of the original, multi-dimensional data set onto the 2-dimensional plane of Fig. 2, eight value clusters are found."
- "Although the characteristics of the eight clusters appear to be reasonably described by the two axes of Fig. 2, the reduction of all value orientations or worldviews to eight clusters in a 2-dimensional plane is a statistical construct"
- "Taking into account that the principal component analysis explains only a rather limited part of the total variability in value orientations, the question remains to what extend the 2-dimensional circular pattern of Fig. 2 can be seen as a meaningful representation of the integral worldview."

#### What is the role of opposites in value orientation? Account for this picture in your response: (picture captioned "integral worldview")

- "It is concluded that the major contrasts in value orientations that are found in nowadays societal surveys confirm the fundamental contrasts identified by the important philosophers over the past centuries."
- "When the results of the value surveys are enriched with the insights of these philosophers, a next and more robust version of the ensemble of worldviews, i.e., the integral worldview, is obtained (Fig. 3)."
- "The integral worldview describes the human-position in between ‘heaven and earth’ and in between the 'I' and 'the others'."
- "Further, the integral worldview is presented as a circular pattern, given the notion that it not only represents the major contrasts along the vertical and horizontal axis, but also all the ‘secondary’, diagonal contrasts in between, for example 'rationality' versus 'emotions' in Fig. 3."

#### What causes overshoot and collapse of worldviews? Provide examples.

- "A central thesis of this paper is that particular worldviews dominate society during certain periods in the sense that a majority of (influential) people adhere to and articulate such a worldview. In such periods other worldviews are less dominant, absent, or even actively suppressed."
- "Fig. 4. Overshoot and collapse of worldviews."
- "Under pressure of the increasing popularity of early Christianity, the Roman emperor Constantin accepted the new religion which he institutionalized into the Roman Catholic Church. At the end of the 4th century, diversity of individual faith was replaced by dogmatic uniformity."
- "In his book 'From Darwin to Hitler' the historian Weikart shows in detail how very gradually Darwin's ideas were perverted into the ideology of Nazism. In the same way in which certain plant species cannot keep up with the evolutionary process, certain groups of people fall victim to the process of evolution."
- "The overemphasis on the production factor labor at the extreme left orientation in state communism has been replaced by the equally one-sided emphasis on the production factor capital at the extreme right hand side position. The result is a financial crisis which forms an actual threat for societal sustainability."

#### Notes from class

- When worldviews are too polarized, it's hard to balance (i.e., bring it back together again)
