# Emerging disruptions and technology

## Answers

### Page 1

#### One ancient example of disruptive tech

Throughout history, there have been countless examples of disruptive technology. If you think about it, all time periods (Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age, and Information Age) have been classified so because of technology. Though the Iron Age was largely called so because of locally produced iron and steel that was a significant improvement from its precursory bronze tools, today's Information Age has seen an exponential decade-over-decade growth (as classified by the Moore's Law, though it has an uncertain future).

In ancient history, we've seen the  machine planter ("seed drill") that was used by the Babylonians to sows seeds for crops by positioning them in the soil and burying them deep inside. Already in 1400 BCE, Babylonians were using primitive versions of the seed drills we still use today. In terms of weaponry, which has frequently been the primary way of "diplomacy" until very recent history, we've seen bow and arrows been used as early as tens of thousands of years ago (Backwell, d'Errico, Wadley, 2008).

#### The three recent revolutions, dates and eventualities

According to Majumdar, Banerji, and Chakrabarti, the three industrial revolutions started in 1765, 1870, and 1969 respectively. In the first one, we learned how to use water and steam to mechanize our production capabilities (which was primarily lead by human labor before late 18th century). In the second, we started using electric energy to mass produce products; and in the third, we started using electronics and information technology to automate production.

#### What characterizes the fourth revolution in the "present scenario"

The authors explore what the fourth industrial revolution is, which they say is powered by the emergence of the Internet and digitization of processes. For example, new technologies such as the Internet of Things enable you to turn on lights in your apartment from your smartphone. The biological sphere is also disrupted by the fourth revolution, and we've seen significant work in the fields of human enhancement, life sciences, and my favorite — longevity.

Although the authors' focus in this paper has been on more physical technology progress like robotics and 3D printing, I personally classify the fourth revolution as more of a software one. Just like mechanical minds have helps us pick up and move thousands of tons of weight, and computer minds help us perform millions of calculations in an instant, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence will lead what we can do in the future. Though the authors clearly highlight the benefits of ML/AI, I believe that a combination of decision-making AI and biotechnology will be the "killer app" of the future.

#### List 4th revolution disruptive technologies. At what does industry aim?

In general, all industries will feel the change as the fourth revolution accelerates its growth. In the third industrial revolution, we saw automotive manufacturing become completely automated; just like this, we can expect almost all processes we have set up automated by intelligent systems. In the paper, the authors say that the factories of tomorrow will be increasingly embedded in smart cities. I am also a strong believer in building sustainable cities, enabling a symbiotic relationship nature and technology.

As Jeff White says, if you do an image search for "utopia", you'll see photos of futuristic flying cars and neighborhoods in the center of trees and greenery; it is our collective, perhaps evolutionary, vision to be in a nature-preserving, sustainable society. The authors also mention how the cloud, big data and data analytics, AI, and IoT will reshape industries. They specifically highlight industrial robots and changes to the energy sector as more focus is and resources are shifted towards renewable energy and sustainable development.

#### Education - describe advances and projected disruptions

Education technology is a personal story for me. I founded my first company, Class Rebels, when I was in high school with a focus on "fixing" school education through open and collaborative learning. If you look at a photo of a classroom from a century ago, you probably won't notice too many differences — one professor in the front monologuing for tens (or hundreds) of students sitting in a group. The education industry hasn't seen as significant change as others, but this is changing rapidly.

Organizations like Khan Academy are ensuring every student can get access to world-class education using the web, and new technologies like Augmented Reality help students visualize concepts and diagrams in 3D. The authors say that the "education sector will be highly impacted by the developments in disruptive information and communications technologies, and corresponding innovative changes in pedagogy." In the near future, the norm might shift from its current state of focusing on high return-value programs like engineering, medicine, and management and to a more interdisciplinary approach to education, with increasing focus shifting towards distance education.

#### Robotics - describe advances and projected disruptions

As robots become more sophisticated and can sense more information (and perhaps become even more intelligent), they will eventually be able to perform more and more tasks currently done by humans. The primary benefit is that a mechanical mind doesn't get tired, doesn't need sleep, and doesn't make mistakes. The authors highlight that industrial robots will work in three shifts, seven days a week without any unionization and industrial relations problems. The further say that  the companies which use such robots in large numbers will produce goods and services at very competitive rates, and therefore will be much more likely to adversely impact traditional manufacturers, finally leading to significant job losses. In my opinion, this has already started to happen, and our current financial and societal institutions are not prepared to deal with this.

#### 3D printers - describe advances and projected disruptions

3D printers are awesome! I've been very fortunate to have had several opportunities to print items, thanks to SmartXP and the Design Lab, and the authors agree. They say that "3D printers will make forging, die-casting, lathe turning, drilling, broaching, brick laying (for building, construction), RCC work, etc., partially or completely redundant." With 3D printers (and more importantly, an easy to use interface), end users will be easily able to manufacture their own household items like toys and general-use products like mugs and pen holders.

As this eliminates several small industries and the need to go to a brick and mortar store altogether, it will have a significant impact on the economy as a whole, as many small businesses and retail shops shut down. Furthermore, academic courses like mechanical engineering will have to change their focus and syllabus to include this new world. However, the cost of 3D printers and related technologies will have to reduce significantly (e.g., 100 times) for this to happen. Throughout history, we've seen products like televisions and smartphones become 100x cheaper, so it's something to look forward to.

#### What will be required due to the displacement of human workers; and, if the projections of this paper are correct, then we will need more of which kinds of activities? By implication, which sorts of skills may be most beneficial?

The authors present a future where disruptive technology means job loss for people, which means people will have a lot more free time for leisure time activities. We'll have to find innovative new ways to keep very large sections of the population engaged and performing new types of activities. Furthermore, there might even be a need for a Universal Basic Income (#TeamYang!) to sustain these unemployed, but more importantly — unemployable, workers. I think the tourism industry will start to see a substantial increase in revenue as more and more people find time to see the world. The best skillset to keep in this world is to be interdisciplinary, not highly specialized, and be able to quickly learn new skills and adapt to the industry's everchanging needs.

#### Future concerns? Describe.

According to Moore's law the number of transistors, per square millimeter on an integrated circuit, doubles every 12 to 18 months. We've seen this exponential growth happen for over a decade (though we have reason to suspect that it may be unsustainable), a lot of threats emerge. For example, cyber security is an evergrowing field because of cyber crime (think hacking as a form or terrorism and threats like viruses), and new technologies must be developed to deal with them and preserve the security of our most important information networks. Interestingly, non-terrorism threats in academia are already being researched, like quantum computers breaking encryption by being really good at dividing prime numbers.

#### How may we view history? Explain "limits to growth" in this context. What are the causes of unsustainability? What has failed to reach popular awareness?

According to the authors, we can look at human history as a sequence of disruptive discontinuities or punctuated equilibriums. Whether they are disruptive discontinuities or punctuated equilibriums depends on what you want to emphasize on, change or stasis. Interestingly, the authors highlight that change accelerates, and the qualities of life developed by local systems cannot be sustained. They further explore this through a computer simulation model that showcases that the scale of theses processes of change approach the scale of the entire planet, and their rate of change is still exponential.

We can see this through population, productivity growth, and the resources we're using, not unlike the rate of exponential growth we're seeing with the COVID-19 pandemic. The problem is that this growth is harmful for our ecology; it's correlated with environmental impact and unsustainability, specifically due to overconsumption by the rich and overexploitation by the poor. Looking at the date, the United States uses 6,917 kgoe/a of energy per capita, vs. around 650 for India, more than 10 times (World Development Indicators). However, India might need to get a much larger quantity of natural resources out to sustain her large population. This causes unsustainability.

#### Define "sustainable development" and explain what it must deliver in terms of "quality of life".

The concept of sustainable development has been defined in several ways. In this paper, the authors refer to the Brundtland Commission (formerly WCED) adopted in 1983, that defines sustainable development as "development that meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs." For us, this means making sure we leave enough behind for future generations, and leave the planet in a better state than how we found it. In terms of quality of life, we can expect a high quality of life depending on our definition of it; as the authors say, "a person's experience of a good quality of life is often equally or more dependent on the available options, i.e., on the capabilities, than on the actual realization of these options."

So, it is proposed to define quality of life on the basis of our capabilities rather than on our functionings. For sustainable development, this means that given the fact that our capabilities are severely constrained by environmental and economic factors, the subjective quality of life can be linked to environmental and resource impact. This means more social interactions, and perhaps a better quality of life. Personally, this really depends on what one's outlook towards life is, and how one measures happiness. Last year, I was part of Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation's annual conference, "Goalkeepers", in New York City, which focuses on the implementation of the Global Goals, UN's sustainable development goals. As a Goalkeeper, for me, sustainable development brings us to a good quality of life.

#### What "enigmatic question" are the authors trying to solve and how do they propose to do it?

In this paper, the authors discuss the apparent paradox that according to the Brundtland definition discussed above, sustainable development can be seen as the continuation of a certain set of capabilities, which depends on personal values, part of your own perspective on what a good life is. However, those very capabilities are constrained by factors outside our control, like economic winds, a lack of sufficient resources, and the environment. That is the enigmatic question discussed in this paper.

According to the authors, the Brundtland Commission "apparently assumes (inter-generational) equity between present and future generations," and this raises our question wherein our needs are equally valued by future as well as present generations, and at the same time they can be realized within the increasing constraints on our capabilities. To answer this, the authors propose understanding the relation between human value orientations, and the corresponding capabilities, which is what we do in the next section.

#### Explain the relationship between value orientation and capability.

In the figure in this paper, authors take a visual approach to explaining the relationship between value orientations and capability. In that figure, value orientations and capabilities are visible on two levels wherein the lower level has capabilities that depends on the choices make that come from positions on the upper plane. Figuratively, we see that there isn't a direct relationship here; different value orientations can mean different views, and choosing specific orientations take us in a specific direction of achieving the specific quality of life. Here, we see both roles of value orientations: to value relevant orientations that bring us to the desired quality of life, and interpreting the capabilities that in the lower plane.

#### Distinguish between predictive and descriptive assumptions. What do these "encompass"?

Prescriptive assumptions are value orientations and answer the question "How important are certain things and themes over others?" They are subjective and depend on the quality of life we've chosen ourselves, which are on the upper plane in the author's figure. On the other hand, descriptive assumptions talk about out belief system about how the world functions. They are essentially "mental maps" that we've thought of, and are more objective in nature. They help us frame the way our decided quality of life can be reached or maintained by the capabilities available to us, which are in the lower plane in the author's figure. Overall, the figure is a great way to visualize how we want to think about the relationship between orientations and capabilities, along with understanding predictive and descriptive assumptions

#### What are "worldviews"?

A worldview is "an intellectual perspective on the world or universe" (Funk, Ken, 2001), as the name suggests. Though in metaphysics, a worldview deals with the nature of reality itself; in this paper, the authors describe a worldview as a "combination of a person's value orientation and \[their] view on how to understand the world and the capabilities it offers". In a sense, it's the lens through which we look at the world. If we want to find out what a person's worldview is, we can ask them (called surveying), analyze the data collected over the past centuries, and learn from notions from different cultures and religions. However, it is important to remember that history can teach us about the evolution of worldviews, but not what they are today; they are ever-evolving, just the humans believing them.

#### Account for this picture: (picture captioned "major value orientations in the population)

In this paper, the authors say that "the original distribution of value orientations is multi-dimensional" and provide us with a powerful tool to visualize this. Though the figure is just a statistical representation on a plane, it suggests a concept the authors call "value space", which is extremely useful in defining the two main dimensions of contrast giving and taking, and small and big world. Both of these dimensions are visualized on two axes, up-down and left-right respectively.

When we look at the up-down axis, we see that religion and worldly views, and materialistic and immaterialistic views contrast each other. We can think of these as the difference between United States and Tibet, one region obsessed with materialistic possessions and private property, and one with a dominant immaterialistic worldview. On the left-right axis, we see our orientation of local communities versus the entire planet as one single community. This goes one step forward and shows us the high contrast between tiny communities and individuals versus collectives. We can think of this like the state of Europe before and after the second world war — one where each power is in war with the other, and the other where we cannot imagine separating the highly intercultural and interwoven economies and societies of the European Union. In the figure, the authors show eight primary value clusters after projecting the original dataset on the 3D plane.

#### What is the role of opposites in value orientation? Account for this picture in your response: (picture captioned "integral worldview")

As discussed above, the author's figures are a powerful tool to visualize the seeming contrast in value orientations. The authors show that "major contrasts in value orientations that are found in nowadays societal surveys confirm the fundamental contrasts identified by the important philosophers over the past centuries." In this figure, the integral worldview is shows in a circle; I like to think of this as showing not just that there is a lot of contrast in the axes, but also that there is a diagonal relationship, for example between "rationality" and "emotions". This is the role of opposites in this figure. Furthermore, this integral worldview can tell us where we are in between "heaven and earth" and "I" vs "others". This is highly interesting to me, because parapsychologist Susan Blackmore writes that humans don't even have the concept of "me vs. the rest" until they turn three; it is a construct. Therefore, finding outselves somewhere in this spectrum helps define our worldview. In this paper, the "integral" worldview is obtained after analyzing the insights of philosophers.

#### What causes overshoot and collapse of worldviews? Provide examples.

In this paper, the authors say that "worldviews dominate society during certain periods", meaning that there are times where the majority of a population and its influential members adhere to a particular worldview. Of course, a repercussions of this is that other worldviews might be absent, or in some cases, suppressed (ahem, China, ahem). For example, under pressure from the increasingly popular religion of Christianity, the Roman emperor Constantin accepted the new religion which he institutionalized into the Roman Catholic Church. At the end of the 4th century, diversity of individual faith was replaced by dogmatic uniformity. In my opinion, when worldviews become too polarized, it's hard to bring them back together and have a balanced view. This is why we've seen modern powers like the United States in a mess recently, because of the high contrast of two dominant political affiliations that seem to convey contradictory worldviews. To reach equilibrium, there is often a collapse of worldviews where again a new worldview is embraced by a society, in a cycle.

The following are quotes from "Sustainability: The search for the integral worldview", available at https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016328711001340#sec0035 and cited as:

> N. D. van Egmond and H. J. M. de Vries, "Sustainability: The search for the integral worldview," Futures, vol. 43, no. 8, pp. 853–867, 2011, doi: 10.1016/j.futures.2011.05.027.

#### How may we view history? Explain "limits to growth" in this context. What are the causes of unsustainability? What has failed to reach popular awareness?

- "Human history can be seen as a sequence of disruptive discontinuities or punctuated equilibriums, depending on whether the emphasis is on change or stasis. Change happens at an ever increasing scale and rate. Local and regional civilizations and the qualities of life they had developed for their citizens could not be sustained."
- "As was explored for the first time with a computer simulation model in the report Limits to Growth to the Club of Rome, the scale of these processes of change is now approaching the scale of the planet. Moreover, their rate of change is still exponential: population, industrial output, resource use and pollutant emission keep growing and may well overshoot the earth carrying capacity."
- "It linked environmental (un)sustainability to both the overconsumption by the rich populations and poverty-driven overexploitation by the poor populations."
- "Apparently, the call for a 'sustainable development' in both reports did so far not result in sufficiently effective changes in population growth, resource use and technological developments to avoid the serious negative impacts for which both reports warned."
- "The discussion about human needs, as raised by the Brundtland Commission, so far did not result in public awareness, let alone national or global policies."
- "Not only does it confirm the conclusion of the Commission that the solutions of the sustainability problem has to be found in human needs and value orientations, but also it concludes that the ongoing trends to un-sustainability result from recurring and predictable imbalances in the societal value orientations and the related visions on the quality of life."

#### Define "sustainable development" and explain what it must deliver in terms of "quality of life".

- "The Brundtland Commission defined sustainable development as "development that meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.""
- "In first instance, one would associate a good quality of life with the extent to which people can function according to their value orientation. However, a person's experience of a good quality of life is often equally or more dependent on the available options, i.e., on the capabilities, than on the actual realization of these options."
- "Sen therefore proposes to define quality of life on the basis of capabilities rather than on functionings. Given the fact that the capabilities are constrained, for example by environmental or economic factors, the subjective 'quality of life' concept can be connected to the more objective environmental and resource aspect, which in turn is the result of social interactions."

#### What "enigmatic question" are the authors trying to solve and how do they propose to do it?

- "Following this line of thought, sustainable development in the Brundtland definition is seen as the continuation of a certain set of capabilities, depending on a person's value orientation, as part of his or her individual perception of 'the good life'"
- "On the other hand the realization of the required capabilities might be constrained by environmental factors or resource scarcity."
- "The Brundtland Commission apparently assumes (inter-generational) equity between present and future generations and this raises the paradoxical question which needs are equally valued by future as well as present generations, and at the same time can be realized within the increasing constraints on the physical capabilities"
- "In order to solve this enigmatic question, the relation between the human value orientations and the corresponding capabilities should be understood." 

#### Explain the relationship between value orientation and capability.

- "Value orientations and capabilities can be seen as two parallel levels, which are depicted in Fig. 1 as two parallel 2-dimensional planes. Which capabilities in the lower plane are to be realized depends on the choices made, and thus positions taken in the upper plane."
- "The dependency of the (choice for) capabilities from the value orientations goes further than the straightforward end-means relation. Different value orientations imply also different views on the relevance of certain capabilities and their mutual relations and interactions."
 - "In practice affinity to specific value orientations (quality of life ends) will coincide with affinity to specific beliefs about how to achieve these ends by quality of life means."
 - "Apparently value orientations have a twofold role; to value what is worthwhile with respect to quality of life and, secondly, how to interpret the role and meaning of capabilities therein."

#### Distinguish between predictive and descriptive assumptions. What do these "encompass"?

- "prescriptive assumptions refer to value orientations, to the question about the importance of certain things and themes over others. They are subjective and refer to a certain, chosen quality of life and are represented by the upper plane in Fig. 1;"
- "descriptive assumptions refer to the belief system about how the world functions, to mental maps of how things work. They usually have a more shared, objective nature and frame the way in which the chosen quality of life can be reached or maintained by the capabilities represented by the lower plane in Fig. 1."

#### What are "worldviews"?

- "A worldview is thus defined as a combination of a person's value orientation and his or her view on how to understand the world and the capabilities it offers, the lens through which the world is seen."
- "There are several ways to acquire knowledge about peoples worldviews: (1) social surveys among present day people (2) psychological and philosophical insights gained over the last millennia (3) notions from cultures and religions (4) empirical observations and experiences in the ‘laboratory’ of human history."

#### Account for this picture: (picture captioned "major value orientations in the population)

- "The original distribution of value orientations is multi-dimensional. In first instance for practical reasons, this multi-dimensional data set is reduced by a principal component analysis to the two dimensions which are statistically the most relevant ones and which constitute the 2-dimensional plane of drawing in Fig. 2."
- "The figure suggests that the multidimensional ‘value space’ can be statistically meaningful reduced to two main dimensions: the contrast giving (upper) versus taking (lower) and the contrast small world (right) versus big-world (left)."
- "The first component along the vertical axis is very close to the contrast religious versus worldly and im-materialistic versus materialistic. The second component on the horizontal axis can be associated with an orientation on the own local community versus the world as a whole or, from a more individual stance as the contrast between self and the other(s) and between individual and collective."
- "After projection of the original, multi-dimensional data set onto the 2-dimensional plane of Fig. 2, eight value clusters are found."
- "Although the characteristics of the eight clusters appear to be reasonably described by the two axes of Fig. 2, the reduction of all value orientations or worldviews to eight clusters in a 2-dimensional plane is a statistical construct"
- "Taking into account that the principal component analysis explains only a rather limited part of the total variability in value orientations, the question remains to what extend the 2-dimensional circular pattern of Fig. 2 can be seen as a meaningful representation of the integral worldview."

#### What is the role of opposites in value orientation? Account for this picture in your response: (picture captioned "integral worldview")

- "It is concluded that the major contrasts in value orientations that are found in nowadays societal surveys confirm the fundamental contrasts identified by the important philosophers over the past centuries."
- "When the results of the value surveys are enriched with the insights of these philosophers, a next and more robust version of the ensemble of worldviews, i.e., the integral worldview, is obtained (Fig. 3)."
- "The integral worldview describes the human-position in between ‘heaven and earth’ and in between the 'I' and 'the others'."
- "Further, the integral worldview is presented as a circular pattern, given the notion that it not only represents the major contrasts along the vertical and horizontal axis, but also all the ‘secondary’, diagonal contrasts in between, for example 'rationality' versus 'emotions' in Fig. 3."

#### What causes overshoot and collapse of worldviews? Provide examples.

- "A central thesis of this paper is that particular worldviews dominate society during certain periods in the sense that a majority of (influential) people adhere to and articulate such a worldview. In such periods other worldviews are less dominant, absent, or even actively suppressed."
- "Fig. 4. Overshoot and collapse of worldviews."
- "Under pressure of the increasing popularity of early Christianity, the Roman emperor Constantin accepted the new religion which he institutionalized into the Roman Catholic Church. At the end of the 4th century, diversity of individual faith was replaced by dogmatic uniformity."
- "In his book 'From Darwin to Hitler' the historian Weikart shows in detail how very gradually Darwin's ideas were perverted into the ideology of Nazism. In the same way in which certain plant species cannot keep up with the evolutionary process, certain groups of people fall victim to the process of evolution."
- "The overemphasis on the production factor labor at the extreme left orientation in state communism has been replaced by the equally one-sided emphasis on the production factor capital at the extreme right hand side position. The result is a financial crisis which forms an actual threat for societal sustainability."
