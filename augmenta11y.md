Dyslexia is the most common learning disability. At its core, it makes reading hard, which is perhaps the most important part for school education. This is why children with dyslexic often do not get high grades, but this has nothing to do with their intelligence. In India, there are 3.5 Crore children with dyslexia currently in schools.

Tushar Gupta, Mudita Sisodia, Schezeen Fazulbhoy, and Mitali Raju, students of Mukesh Patel School of Technology Management & Engineering, have invented a new way of solving this problem using a smartphone app. Augmenta11y is a completely free app (no ads) for both Android and iOS devices which helps children with dyslexia read books in the real world using their phone's camera.

Augmenta11y is part of Shravan apps, a set of smartphone apps marketed by Oswald Labs for people with disabilities. Oswald Labs previously showed a sneak peek of these apps at the Dutch Design Week in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, in partnership with 4TU, the federation of four leading Dutch technical universities. Other Shravan apps include Live Subtitles for people with hearing impairment and Visib11y for people with visual impairment.

In a research conducted by the team on 12-14 year old children with dyslexia, they found an average decrease of 21.03% in reading time across all the students. Furthermore, 93% of the children agreed that a change in contrast between the background and the text, an exclusive feature of the app, helped improve readability. This means that a student spending one hour to read a chapter in his or her textbook can now read it in 40 minutes.

Starting with Augmenta11y, Oswald Labs has set up a Research Fund where they contribute 10% of their annual profits into conducing new research and development for such technologies and measuring the impact it does on society.
