Dyslexia is the most common learning disability. At its core, it makes reading hard, which is perhaps the most important part for school education. This is why children with dyslexic often do not get high grades, but this has nothing to do with their intelligence. In India, there are 3.5 Crore children with dyslexia currently in schools.
