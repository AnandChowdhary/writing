# Anand Chowdhary’s Mailing List

## April 2020 Campaign

Dear *|FNAME|*,

You're receiving this email because I consider you a close friend, or because you signed up for my mailing list on my website. I plan on sending these letters no more than 1–2 times a year, just to update you about major milestones. My initial idea was to send out my first newsletter as I graduate next quarter with a plan for the coming year, but there have been significant developments in the past month I want to share.

Of course, if you prefer not to hear from me, you can click on this link to unsubscribe, no hard feelings: *|UNSUB|*.

### Our COVID-19 response

I'm currently in the middle of my graduation semester at the University of Twente, and I flew back (in a hurry!) to India a few weeks ago. I literally got on one of the last flights out of the Netherlands, so I've been home in New Delhi since then. Thankfully, everyone I know is safe, both in Europe and in India.

For the past few weeks, I've been working alongside an incredible team of nonprofits, startups, and corporates on **Karuna 2020**, an initiative to help families sustain during the COVID-19 lockdown in India. Because of the lockdown, daily wage workers and those in the unorganized sector are most affected, and we need to step up and do our part in helping them sustain.

We've built a Dry Ration Pack consisting of 10 kg rice, 2 kg dal (Indian pulses), 1 kg salt, 1 L mustard oil, 4 soap bars, and 100 g Indian spices. This kit will help sustain a family of 4–5 for 1 month. So far, we've distributed over 2,000 such kits in and around New Delhi, helping feed over 10,000 people for a month, along with distributing thousands of masks to police and healthcare workers. To make this possible, we've raised over ₹16 lakh (€20,000), primarily from friends and family.

Karuna 2020 is also 100% remote, volunteer-led, open-source, and transparent. This means that all of the money we receive is spent on sustaining families, not salaries. Our data, including donations, procurement costs, distributions locations, is open source on GitHub. We also verify every beneficiary and publish photos of each distribution to ensure complete accountability to our donors.

### How you can help

**Contribute generously:** If you work from home (like I do), chances are you'll come out of this pandemic nearly unaffected. To help those who wouldn't, go to our website and contribute. To feed a family of 4–5 for one month, an amount equivalent to $10 is more than enough. If you're Indian, we'll also send you an 80G tax deduction invoice.

**Volunteer your time:** If you can spend a few hours per week for the next few weeks remotely, fill our volunteer form. We need help with procurement, distributions, fundraising, tech, and marketing. If you know someone else who can help, let me know.

**Share with your friends:** If you simply forward this email or share the link to our website (karuna2020.org) to some of your friends, more people will know about us, and it'll help us sustain more families. Our goal is to help sustain 10,000 families, and we're only 20% there so far.

### Thanks!

The next time you hear from me is in the second half of 2020. Apart from Karuna 2020, I'm working with Dutch cloud telephony company Speakup on building an email-based intelligent virtual assistant, as part of my graduation thesis for Creative Technology BSc. Oswald Labs is continuing to work on our end-to-end web accessibility platform. I also have some other projects in the pipeline. More updates to follow.

I hope you and your loved ones stay safe.

Anand
