Evolutionary biology essay

> Once you have a suitable topic, the next step depends on the nature of the topic. If there is a lot known about the topic, you could decide to write a kind of survey paper about it. The goal could for instance be to give a historical overview of the scientific discoveries, explanations, views, etc. But alternatively, if for instance the material of the topic is complicated and technical, you could also be aiming to cover only the current knowledge about it. And in case there are controversial scientific views and opinions about the topic, you could also decide to write an essay, explaining the different views and concluding with your own view, based on the scientific evidence you found most convincing. For the presentation you have similar options, depending on the topic and what you found out about it. If you are in doubt about it, talk to your fellow students or get back to us for feedback and discussions.

> In all cases, a paper, essay or presentation should have a "head, tail, and main body": an introductory part (covering items like background, motivation, some historical account, the problem statement or research question, etc.), a number of sections, depending to a large extend on the nature of the topic, describing the problem/question(s) in more detail, the approach taken to solve the problem or answer the question(s), the scientific evidence or experiments, finds, interpretations, etc., in some cases the difference with respect to other proposed solutions, explanations, interpretations, etc., sometimes more discussions, open questions, and recommendations for further research, and a concluding part, where a kind of summary is given based on the content or evidence in the earlier sections.

## Introduction

#### definition of consciousness
In general, consciousness is what allows us to be aware both of our surroundings and of our own inner state (Van Gulick, 2014 [1]). The term "consciousness" used with a diversity of meanings, and applied both to whole organisms — creature consciousness — and to particular mental states and processes — state consciousness (Rosenthal 1986, Gennaro 1995, Carruthers 2000).

#### creature consciousness
An animal, person, or other cognitive system may be regarded as conscious in a number of different senses: sentience, wakefulness, self-consciousness, "what it is like", subject of conscious states, and transitive consciousness.

##### sentience
The cognitive system may be conscious in the generic sense of simply being a sentient creature, one capable of sensing and responding to its world (Armstrong 1981). In this regard, questions such as "Are fish conscious?" can be asked (Van Gulick, 2014).

##### wakefulness
Thinking of consciousness as only when an organism is awake and normally alert, it would not count as conscious when asleep or in any of the deeper levels of coma. Questions such as "Is one conscious when hypnotized or dreaming?" make this line very blurry.

##### self-consciousness
An even more demanding definition might be that conscious creatures are those that are not only aware but also aware that they are aware, thus treating creature consciousness as a form of self-consciousness (Carruthers, 2000).

#### state consciousness

Philosophers and scientists struggle to define consciousness. Different schools and ideas compete with one another, but no one has come close to figuring it out. In this fuzzy area, consciousness and intelligence are also related, although they are not the same.

Like much of what makes us human, our consciousness is likely to have evolved from less complex forms, as a product of evolution by natural selection. It has probably emerged from an immense several-100-million years sequence of countless micro steps, that together make up a sort of gradient of consciousness.

## Evolution

#### what is conscious?
What was the first step on this path from the non-conscious to the basic consciousness that ultimately led to the convoluted consciousness we humans enjoy today? Take a stone. The consensus is that a stone is not conscious. Though, not everyone agrees even on this. Some panpsychists claim that a lump of rock may have an inner life. However, there are no real grounds for any such assumption since stones never show behaviour. Their inner life can neither be proven nor disproven.

#### living things & energy
A more common starting point is with the living things. A living thing, or a self, is a part of the universe that sustains itself and makes more of its kind. To do so, it needs energy. And this is where an awareness of the world comes in handy.

#### random motion
The original function of consciousness was probably to direct a mobile self that was short of energy to a fresh supply of food. On the smaller scales of life, you don't need to be aware to find food. Trichopax adhaerens - one of the simplest of all animals moves around haphazardly. It slows down in the presence of food, and speeds up in its absence. This is highly effective, and makes the tiny creature spend more time where there is food spend more time where there is food than where there is not. But it never moves in a particular direction towards a particular target, and there's no need for it to be conscious of its environment.

#### directional motion
The first major step towards consciousness was probably taken when mobile selves started to move themselves directionally. Moving towards what was good for them, say food, and away from what was less good, say someone else who thought that they were food. Take Dugesia tigrina - a tiny worm known for its funny face. Sometimes the worm is hungry, and sometimes not. This means that when it moves, the worm self is not simply producing an automatic response to an external stimulus, but that its actions depend upon its inner, physiological state, whether it's hungry or sated. When it's just eaten, the worm is less energetic, but when starved for a while, it will move itself in the direction of tasty things. It uses chemoreceptors on its head to smell its environment, and guide it in the direction where the scent of food is strongest. After finding and eating a meal, our worm buddy heads back to a dark sheltered spot to digest it in safety, until it's hungry again. But animals that blindly follow their sense of smell don't have a concrete objective in view. They still lack any sense of where they are heading.

## Context

#### vision
So, the next step on the ladder of consciousness is to add some perception at a distance, like vision. Vision adds context and depth to our world. With vision comes a sense of the space we and our food exists in. It adds a whole new dimension to awareness, and is a huge step towards more familiar consciousness. An optical apparatus, like an eye, enables us to visualise our goal and lock onto it. But even at this stage, a self is only able to pursue its food as long as it sees it. So, the next logical step needs to happen on the inside.

#### object permanence
To visualise food in its absence, for example, a self needs to create some sort of inner representation of the world. Now, an animal can continue looking for food, even when it escapes its sensory range. Because of this inner representation of what is relevant in the world, it can remain focused on its food and its desire to get it. Our self now exists in a world it can get familiar with. The ability to remember things has emerged. Thanks to memory, animals can be distracted from the pursuit for a few seconds, but quickly continue their path afterwards. A related phenomenon is called 'object permanence'. This describes our awareness that things continue to exist even when we can't see them. This cognitive skill is enjoyed by some mammals and birds, and perhaps other animals too. Human babies tend to develop this ability around the time they turn eight months, while baby chickens show this ability within a day or two of being born.

#### memory
The capacity to remember a thing in its absence suggests at least a basic sense of time. A sense of time is a big step on the ladder of consciousness. It may also enable a self to look forward from the present moment and anticipate the future. Adult chickens, for example, are able to resist a meal put in front of them if they expect to receive a bigger meal as a prize for holding back for a while. This sort of delayed gratification means there is an ability to visualize a reward that only exists in the future, which can be quite a challenge even for adult humans.

####  "understanding" others
Western scrub jays are experts in delayed gratification. They show an even more elaborate sense of the future when they hide food in a cache to retrieve it at a later date. The scrub jays will even rehide their food if they become aware that a potential thief has been watching them. This means that they know that there are other hungry selves out there, who are aware and see the world from their own, different perspective. Crafty scrub jays can sort of read the mind of their fellow birds. This ability to mind-read is crucial for complex levels of consciousness. By putting yourself in the position of others, you can outsmart a rich competitor, or empathise with a hungry friend.

#### language
Language takes the ability to read minds and represent what is absent to a whole new level. Words enable us to construct hypotheses about the world, make detailed plans, and to communicate them with others. Words enable us to think about ourselves and our place in the universe, and even about our own consciousness.

## Conclusion

So, what is the origin of our consciousness? It probably began as the directed motion of a hungry self towards a source of food. With the survival benefits, this gave it over competitors that moved at random or not at all. It probably all started with the urge for more food. So, even with the sophisticated consciousness that allows us to dream about space, build skyscrapers, or obsess about novels, it's not surprising that we can't stop thinking about where we'll get our next meal. Collectively, we've put so much thought and ingenuity into getting food, that we can now just get our food to come to us with little conscious effort.
