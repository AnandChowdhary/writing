# Evolution of consciousness

Anand Chowdhary, Honors: *Origins*, s1930702

## Introduction

### Abstract

When we think and act, there is a very deliberate, conscious effort to do those things. Perhaps this is driven by feeling external stimuli or having internal thought. This literature research paper aims to answer the question "How did consciousness evolve in humans?" through a look at evolutionary biology and to explore the various Darwinian steps to consciousness.

### Background

#### definition of consciousness
In general, consciousness is what allows us to be aware both of our surroundings and of our own inner state (Van Gulick, 2014 [1]). The term "consciousness" used with a diversity of meanings, and applied both to whole organisms — creature consciousness — and to particular mental states and processes — state consciousness (Rosenthal 1986, Gennaro 1995, Carruthers 2000).

#### creature consciousness
An animal, person, or other cognitive system may be regarded as conscious in a number of different senses: sentience, wakefulness, self-consciousness, "what it is like", subject of conscious states, and transitive consciousness.

##### sentience
The cognitive system may be conscious in the generic sense of simply being a sentient creature, one capable of sensing and responding to its world (Armstrong 1981). In this regard, questions such as "Are fish conscious?" can be asked.

##### wakefulness
Thinking of consciousness as only when an organism is awake and normally alert, it would not count as conscious when asleep or in any of the deeper levels of coma. Questions such as "Is one conscious when hypnotized or dreaming?" make this line very blurry (Van Gulick, 2014).

##### self-consciousness
An even more demanding definition might be that conscious creatures are those that are not only aware but also aware that they are aware, thus treating creature consciousness as a form of self-consciousness (Carruthers, 2000).

##### "what it is like"
A being is conscious just if there is "something that it is like" to be that creature, i.e., some subjective way the world seems or appears from the creature's mental or experiential point of view (Nagel, 1974). In Nagel's example, he suggests that bats are conscious, since there is a subjective way to see "what it is like" to be a bat and experience the world through echolocation.

##### transitive consciousness
Lastly, addition to describing creatures as conscious in these various senses, there are also related senses in which creatures are described as being conscious of various things. The distinction is sometimes marked as that between transitive and intransitive notions of consciousness, with the former involving some object at which consciousness is directed (Rosenthal 1986).

#### state consciousness

Being conscious can be broken down to smaller "states" of consciousness. There are at least six major options.

##### states one is aware of
A conscious mental state is simply a mental state one is aware of being in (Rosenthal 1986, 1997). In this sense, conscious states involve a form of meta-mentality or meta-intentionality in so far as they require mental states that are themselves about mental states. For example, to want to watch a movie, one has to have such a desire, and also simultaneously be aware of that face that one had said desire.

##### qualitative states
One might count a state as conscious just if it has or involves qualitative or experiential properties of the sort often referred to as raw sensory feels This is called "qualia," and can be thought of as taste qualia, when taking a sip of coffee, or touch qualia, when feeling cotton. There is considerable disagreement about the nature of such qualia (Churchland 1985, Shoemaker 1990, Clark 1993, Chalmers 1996) and even about their existence.

##### phenomenal states
The aforementioned qualia are sometimes referred to as phenomenal properties and the associated sort of consciousness as phenomenal consciousness. The phenomenal structure of consciousness also encompasses much of the spatial, temporal, and conceptual organization of our experience of the world and of ourselves as agents in it.

##### access consciousness
States might be conscious in a seemingly quite different access sense, which has more to do with intra-mental relations. In this respect, a state's being conscious is a matter of its availability to interact with other states and of the access that one has to its content. In this more functional sense, which corresponds to what Block (1995) calls access consciousness, a visual state's being conscious is not so much a matter of whether or not it has a qualitative "what it's likeness", but of whether or not it and the visual information that it carries is generally available for use and guidance by the organism.

##### narrative consciousness
States might also be regarded as conscious in a narrative sense that appeals to the notion of the "stream of consciousness", regarded as an ongoing more or less serial narrative of episodes from the perspective of an actual or merely virtual self. The idea would be to equate the person's conscious mental states with those that appear in the stream (Dennett 1991, 1992).

#### summary
As noted from the previous definitions, philosophers and biologists have struggled to find a single definition of consciousness, and perhaps no such definition exists. Different schools of thought compete with each another, and some even consider the relationship between intelligence and consciousness. There is a symbiotic relationship between them since consciousness may arise as a result of intelligence, but a general intelligence may not be enough for consciousness (e.g., general-purpose artificial intelligences do not necessarily have to be conscious).

#### evolution by natural selection
Evolution is the process of adaptation through mutation which allows more desirable characteristics to be passed to the next generation. Over time, organisms evolve more characteristics that are beneficial to their survival. For living organisms to adapt and change to environmental pressures, genetic variation must be present. With genetic variation, individuals have differences in form and function that allow some to survive certain conditions better than others. These organisms pass their favorable traits to their offspring. Eventually, environments change, and what was once a desirable, advantageous trait may become an undesirable trait and organisms may further evolve (OpenStax, 2016).

##### history

As described above, evolution by natural selection showcases a mechanism for how species change over time. That species change had been suggested and debated well before Darwin began to explore this idea. The view that species were static and unchanging was grounded in the writings of Plato, yet there were also ancient Greeks who expressed evolutionary ideas. In the 18th century, ideas about the evolution of animals were reintroduced by the naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, who observed that various geographic regions have different plant and animal populations, even when the environments are similar.

Furthermore, it was also already accepted that there were extinct species in the 18th century. In the mid-19th century, the actual mechanism for evolution was independently conceived of and described by two naturalists: Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace. Importantly, each naturalist spent time exploring the natural world on expeditions to the tropics. From 1831 to 1836, Darwin traveled around the world on *HMS Beagle*, including stops in South America, Australia, and the southern tip of Africa. Wallace traveled to Brazil to collect insects in the Amazon rainforest from 1848 to 1852 and to the Malay Archipelago from 1854 to 1862.

Wallace and Darwin both observed similar patterns in other organisms and they independently developed the same explanation for how and why such changes could take place. Darwin called this mechanism natural selection. Natural selection, also known as "survival of the fittest," is the more prolific reproduction of individuals with favorable traits that survive environmental change because of those traits; this leads to evolutionary change. (OpenStax, 2016).

### Problem statement
The answer to the research question "How did consciousness evolve in animals?" can therefore be answered: in organic life, most notably humans, consciousness is likely to have evolved from less complex forms, as a product of evolution by natural selection. Like much of Darwinian outcomes, it is therefore a "gradient" or steam of consciousness and therefore a hard line between conscious and lack thereof cannot be drawn. This essay aims to establish the link between evolution by natural selection and the origin of consciousness and to explore the various stages that lead to the current state of human consciousness.

## Literature research

#### Am I conscious?
The early questions in this literature research are very vague yet fundamental. First, it is assumed that humans are consciousness (I am writing this paper, ain't I?) and some other things are not. For example, the general consensus says that a rock is not conscious. However, even making this assumption is not very easy.

##### panpsychism

The word "panpsychism" literally means that everything has a mind. However, in contemporary debates it is generally understood as the view that mentality is fundamental and ubiquitous in the natural world.

(Goff, Seager, Allen-Hermanson, 2010).

Since there are is no experimental evidence to either prove or disprove panpsychism, though vague as its definition may be, living things are used as a starting point.

#### living things & energy
A more common starting point is with the living things. A living thing, or a self, is a part of the universe that sustains itself and makes more of its kind. To do so, it needs energy. And this is where an awareness of the world comes in handy.

#### random motion
The original function of consciousness was probably to direct a mobile self that was short of energy to a fresh supply of food. On the smaller scales of life, you don't need to be aware to find food. Trichopax adhaerens - one of the simplest of all animals moves around haphazardly. It slows down in the presence of food, and speeds up in its absence. This is highly effective, and makes the tiny creature spend more time where there is food spend more time where there is food than where there is not. But it never moves in a particular direction towards a particular target, and there's no need for it to be conscious of its environment.

#### directional motion
The first major step towards consciousness was probably taken when mobile selves started to move themselves directionally. Moving towards what was good for them, say food, and away from what was less good, say someone else who thought that they were food. Take Dugesia tigrina - a tiny worm known for its funny face. Sometimes the worm is hungry, and sometimes not. This means that when it moves, the worm self is not simply producing an automatic response to an external stimulus, but that its actions depend upon its inner, physiological state, whether it's hungry or sated. When it's just eaten, the worm is less energetic, but when starved for a while, it will move itself in the direction of tasty things. It uses chemoreceptors on its head to smell its environment, and guide it in the direction where the scent of food is strongest. After finding and eating a meal, our worm buddy heads back to a dark sheltered spot to digest it in safety, until it's hungry again. But animals that blindly follow their sense of smell don't have a concrete objective in view. They still lack any sense of where they are heading.

## Context

#### vision
So, the next step on the ladder of consciousness is to add some perception at a distance, like vision. Vision adds context and depth to our world. With vision comes a sense of the space we and our food exists in. It adds a whole new dimension to awareness, and is a huge step towards more familiar consciousness. An optical apparatus, like an eye, enables us to visualise our goal and lock onto it. But even at this stage, a self is only able to pursue its food as long as it sees it. So, the next logical step needs to happen on the inside.

#### object permanence
To visualise food in its absence, for example, a self needs to create some sort of inner representation of the world. Now, an animal can continue looking for food, even when it escapes its sensory range. Because of this inner representation of what is relevant in the world, it can remain focused on its food and its desire to get it. Our self now exists in a world it can get familiar with. The ability to remember things has emerged. Thanks to memory, animals can be distracted from the pursuit for a few seconds, but quickly continue their path afterwards. A related phenomenon is called 'object permanence'. This describes our awareness that things continue to exist even when we can't see them. This cognitive skill is enjoyed by some mammals and birds, and perhaps other animals too. Human babies tend to develop this ability around the time they turn eight months, while baby chickens show this ability within a day or two of being born.

#### memory
The capacity to remember a thing in its absence suggests at least a basic sense of time. A sense of time is a big step on the ladder of consciousness. It may also enable a self to look forward from the present moment and anticipate the future. Adult chickens, for example, are able to resist a meal put in front of them if they expect to receive a bigger meal as a prize for holding back for a while. This sort of delayed gratification means there is an ability to visualize a reward that only exists in the future, which can be quite a challenge even for adult humans.

####  "understanding" others
Western scrub jays are experts in delayed gratification. They show an even more elaborate sense of the future when they hide food in a cache to retrieve it at a later date. The scrub jays will even rehide their food if they become aware that a potential thief has been watching them. This means that they know that there are other hungry selves out there, who are aware and see the world from their own, different perspective. Crafty scrub jays can sort of read the mind of their fellow birds. This ability to mind-read is crucial for complex levels of consciousness. By putting yourself in the position of others, you can outsmart a rich competitor, or empathise with a hungry friend.

#### language
Language takes the ability to read minds and represent what is absent to a whole new level. Words enable us to construct hypotheses about the world, make detailed plans, and to communicate them with others. Words enable us to think about ourselves and our place in the universe, and even about our own consciousness.

## Conclusion

So, what is the origin of our consciousness? It probably began as the directed motion of a hungry self towards a source of food. With the survival benefits, this gave it over competitors that moved at random or not at all. It probably all started with the urge for more food. So, even with the sophisticated consciousness that allows us to dream about space, build skyscrapers, or obsess about novels, it's not surprising that we can't stop thinking about where we'll get our next meal. Collectively, we've put so much thought and ingenuity into getting food, that we can now just get our food to come to us with little conscious effort.
