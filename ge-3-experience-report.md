# GE3 Experience Report

_Anand Chowdhary_

From September to December 2019, I studied at Santa Clara University, California, United States, as part of the Global Engineering Education Exchange. Apart from studying, living in the San Francisco Bay Area was also a remarkable experience.

## Academics

To select the courses I wanted, I had to make the case that I have the relevant background, because my course history was not available to SCU. For this, I sent my transcripts from the UT to SCU’s Study Abroad department, and also directly contacted the professors. I chose a variety of courses from each unique department that I was interested in:

1. ARTS 70: Typography (Department of Art and Art History)
1. CSCI 168: Computer Graphics (Department of Computer Science and Engineering)
1. MGMT 167: Venture Capitalist Essentials (Leavey School of Business Management & Entrepreneurship)
1. MKTG 181: Principles of Marketing (Leavey School of Business Management & Entrepreneurship)

Because I’m very interested in design, I selected the Typography program to learn more about digital and print design. However, since I didn’t have the prerequisite requirement, I went to the Professor Li’s room, showed her my design portfolio, and got her permission to enroll for the course. This course was very fun but required the highest time commitment because of weekly design projects and written exams. I learned more about technical aspects of typefaces, type design history, and aesthetics. As part of the program, I also attended several talks from designers and painters in SCU’s art gallery.

From the engineering side, I selected Computer Graphics, a course focused on C++ and OpenGL, along with relevant math (primarily linear transformations of matrices). As a Creative Technology student (which is not considered the most technical study in the UT), I wanted to prove that I can also perform well in computer science students, so this was a great opportunity for that as well (I ended with a grade of A−). This was a much more technical course, with written math exams and coding assignments. I enjoyed it a lot.

Since I also have a background in entrepreneurship, I wanted to learn more about venture capital, and the Venture Capitalist Essentials course was a great way to learn about investments from the perspective of the investor, not a startup. This was by far my favorite course. Though it was shorter than the others, I learned the most in this course, especially because it was mostly a series of guest lectures by a real Silicon Valley investor, not a university professor. As part of the assignment, I had to evaluate the business plans and pitches of several startups and choose to make an offer. This taught me a lot about terms sheets, legal agreements, predicting the market, and learning to quickly evaluate entire industries based on general trends. This also really helped me with interactions with investors for my own startup.

Lastly, the Principles of Marketing course, also offered by the business school, was the most informal and where I made the maximum number of friends. This course taught me the technical terms and processes when acquiring customers and was a combination of assignments, exams, and marketing project work. Because of the smaller class size, there was a lot of group work, interaction, and collaborative learning.

## Entrepreneurship

Every year, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation organizes Goalkeepers, an event about the Sustainable Development Goals. This is a very exclusive, invite-only event with 300 people from around the world invited every year, and I was incredibly lucky to be invited during my time in the United States. Since the event was in New York City in the middle of the week, I planned a short, two-day trip from Oakland to New York and missed one day of class to participate. This was probably the highlight of my entire trip, because I was sitting only a few feet away from Bill Gates, and the event had speakers like New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez.

I also like to speak at events about entrepreneurship and technology, and that didn’t change while I was in California. I was invited by Santa Clara University’s in-house startup incubator (like Novel-T in Twente) and community OneUp as the first guest speaker of the academic year in their series called Startup Social. In a 90-minute session, I spoke about my entrepreneurial journey and answered a lot of questions from students building their own startups. A video trailer of the event is available on YouTube: [Forbes 30 Under 30 at Santa Clara University](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSX-yDAjUXk). This was a great way to learn more about the startup ecosystem of Santa Clara.

Apart from OneUp, I was also invited to speak at the Women Who Code Cloud 2019 conference in San Francisco. Women Who Code is the world’s largest organization to promote programming for women, and WWCode Cloud was the world’s first cloud conference for women. I spoke for 30 minutes on web accessibility (how to make your products more accessible to people with disabilities), and I was one of the only four male speakers out of 29 total speakers. This was a truly humbling experience, being next to and learning from incredibly talented engineers.

With friends, I also attended tours of technology companies’ campuses in the Bay Area, like Slack, Twitter, and Google Cloud. I spoke extensively to the engineers working there, about life in San Francisco, working at big tech, and their careers.

## Travel

I was living in Dublin in the East Bay, so I extensively traveled around the Bay Area. I went to San Francisco several times for cultural events like stand-up comedy shows, exploring the nightlife, and visiting museums. Apart from the Bay Area, I also visited Los Angeles during my trip. I purchased my ticket for Avril Lavigne’s concert in LA several months before I actually went to California, so I flew down from Oakland to LAX for two days and made the most of my trip. I attended the concert, trekked up to the Hollywood sign, and spent a day at Universal Studios Hollywood, all of which were super fun.

I also spent three weeks on the east coast. After my short, two-day trip to NYC where I barely had enough time to see the city, I went back after my study program was over for a longer duration. One of my friends from CreaTe, Sophie, was also doing a study abroad program at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, so we saw the city together, including the New York Public Library, the World Trade Center, and the Memorial. I also visited the Statue of Liberty, Brooklyn, and Washington DC with my family living in NYC. Sophie and I also saw Boston together, where we participated in the campus tour of Harvard University in Cambridge and walked through the MIT campus as well, all in heavy snow.
