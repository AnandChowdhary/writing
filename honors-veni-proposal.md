## Research Proposal

### 2a1, 2a2, and 2a3. Description of the proposed research

#### 2a1. Overall aim and key objectives, including:
- scientific relevance and challenges;
- originality and innovative character;
- methods and techniques.

##### mini-summary of RQ and approach and expected outcome
In the proposed research, the question asked is: “Does implementing an e-learning solution with data-driven engagement features for homework and practice alongside the classroom increase student grades in secondary education?” For this, a web and app-based platform will be developed and studied to compare results with not having the platform, and each sub-question of this research aims to achieve a proof-of-concept feature in said platform. **The expected outcome of the proposed research will be (web platform that supports …) and (understanding of how such platform impacts ...)**

##### aim
we aim to improve learning and homework

##### motivation: importance, and problematisation, of homework
It has been shown that homework plays a critical, long-term role in the development of student’s achievement motivation and gives them time and experience to develop positive beliefs about achievement. It also teaches them strategies for coping with mistakes, difficulties, and setbacks (Bempechat, 2010). Research conducted in the United States since 1987 also shows that there is generally consistent evidence for a positive influence of homework on a student’s achievement (Cooper et al., 2006). However, the problem of homework completion  has been evidenced by existing grade and homework reports and teacher and student surveys (Renee at al., 1997). The problem aimed to solve that students are not motivated to go home and revise what is being taught in the classroom. This can result in test fatigue when preparing large amounts of content in a short period of time, and also adds pressure and stress in students’ lives.

##### e-learning (and gamification?) has been shown to be helpful in various aspects of learning improvement in general
The problem can be solved by implementing an e-learning solution which can be motivating and engaging for students, so that students practice what they learned in class every day for higher retention and better grades. Many studies have also shown that that effective use of e-learning could help increase student motivation engagement, and attendance. It should also increase student class participation, and improved behavior and performance on core subjects. Students have been proved to be more receptive and willing to solve more complex homework in an e-learning platform than the traditional paper-book (Benta at al., 2014). Furthermore, students’ success rates are also significantly higher for multimedia-based e-learning homework than traditional paper-based homework (Kodippili et al., 2007). 

##### students might appreciate e-learning (technology)
A 2017 study also expects improvements in communication technology (such as higher internet speed at accessible prices) to likely increase the use of multimedia in education [4]. There are already numerous studies which show that students are highly motivated to use new technology. For example, students in Ethiopia were given tablets through the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) scheme, but without any instructors or teachers. They taught themselves how to use the tablets, and even after several months, the students were still heavily engaged in using and recharging them [3]. This shows the curiosity that age group naturally possesses for interacting with new technology, which can be further extended to inclination towards digital means of education.

##### (such e-learning must always be complementary with classroom work)
Therefore, several companies like Byju’s and not-for-profit organizations like Khan Academy are building e-learning platforms which can serve as completed alternatives to classroom learning. However, such a system has its own challenges. For one, it cannot teach students social skills, so there will always be a place where working adults send their kids to be socialized. [INSERT: ARE THERE MORE CHALLENGES YOU COULD MENTION HERE? SUCH AS PERSONALISED LIVE EXPLANATION OR FEEDBACK] *A solution with the right combination of e-learning and classroom learning would be the ideal way for education in secondary school [2]: it should not aim to replace the traditional classroom, but rather complement it with its set of additional strengths.* So therefore, a good e-learning solution should...

###### gap between teacher and technology
Although it has been established that students are comfortable with a digital means of education, there is an increasing gap of awareness between young students and their teachers about technology in general. [4] asks the question “are online instructors ready to meet the 21st century challenges brought by this generation’s demand for the use of technology in education?”. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the average age of a primary school teacher in the Netherlands is 43, which is much younger than that in Italy (50), but would still require an effort from the teacher's end to implement such a solution. [1] A 2017 study from the British University in Egypt found that e-learning success in depends largely on the effectiveness of delivery (which will be detailed in this paper's Tools section) and adequate training of instructors. Inadequately trained staff can become an obstacle in a finely-balanced learning process and can lead to problems in application use and in the perception of students. [4]

##### yet, elearning tech could also offer benefits to teachers
Tools such as analytics of data generated by student usage will not only help teachers make better in-classroom decisions, but also make them more acquainted with homework process and results. Using a digital e-learning platform is also a preferred way for class management and avoids potential errors (Benta at al., 2014).
