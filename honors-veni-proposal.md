## Research Proposal

### 2a1, 2a2, and 2a3. Description of the proposed research

#### 2a1. Overall aim and key objectives, including:
- scientific relevance and challenges;
- originality and innovative character;
- methods and techniques.

##### mini-summary of RQ and approach and expected outcome

In the proposed research, the question asked is: “Does implementing an e-learning solution with data-driven engagement features for homework and practice alongside the classroom increase student grades in secondary education?” For this, a web and app-based platform will be developed and studied to compare results with not having the platform, and each sub-question of this research aims to achieve a proof-of-concept feature in said platform. **The expected outcome of the proposed research will be (web platform that supports …) and (understanding of how such platform impacts ...)**


#### 2a2. Research plan, including:
- practical timetable/timeline over the grant period;
- local, national and international collaboration;
- work plan (in narrative form).

#### 2a3. Motivation for choice of host institute
Indicate why you prefer to carry out your research at the host institute including:
- Reasons for choosing this research group;
- In what way your research complements the already existing research line(s) at the host institute;
- Any other motivation for your choice of the host institute.

### 2b. Knowledge utilisation
(Max. 750 words on max. two pages) 

#### Potential (or explanation of lack thereof), including: 
- contribution to society and/or other scientific areas;
- disciplines and organisations that might benefit from the results.

#### Implementation, including:
- action plan to allow the outcomes of the research project to benefit the potential knowledge users;
