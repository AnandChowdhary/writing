## Research Proposal

### 2a1, 2a2, and 2a3. Description of the proposed research

#### 2a1. Overall aim and key objectives, including:
- scientific relevance and challenges;
- originality and innovative character;
- methods and techniques.

##### mini-summary of RQ and approach and expected outcome
In the proposed research, the question asked is: “Does implementing an e-learning solution with data-driven engagement features for homework and practice alongside the classroom increase student grades in secondary education?” For this, a web and app-based platform will be developed and studied to compare results with not having the platform, and each sub-question of this research aims to achieve a proof-of-concept feature in said platform. **The expected outcome of the proposed research will be (web platform that supports …) and (understanding of how such platform impacts ...)**

##### aim
we aim to improve learning and homework

##### motivation: importance, and problematisation, of homework
It has been shown that homework plays a critical, long-term role in the development of student’s achievement motivation and gives them time and experience to develop positive beliefs about achievement. It also teaches them strategies for coping with mistakes, difficulties, and setbacks (Bempechat, 2010). Research conducted in the United States since 1987 also shows that there is generally consistent evidence for a positive influence of homework on a student’s achievement (Cooper et al., 2006). However, the problem of homework completion  has been evidenced by existing grade and homework reports and teacher and student surveys (Renee at al., 1997). The problem aimed to solve that students are not motivated to go home and revise what is being taught in the classroom. This can result in test fatigue when preparing large amounts of content in a short period of time, and also adds pressure and stress in students’ lives.

##### e-learning (and gamification?) has been shown to be helpful in various aspects of learning improvement in general
The problem can be solved by implementing an e-learning solution which can be motivating and engaging for students, so that students practice what they learned in class every day for higher retention and better grades. Many studies have also shown that that effective use of e-learning could help increase student motivation engagement, and attendance. It should also increase student class participation, and improved behavior and performance on core subjects. Students have been proved to be more receptive and willing to solve more complex homework in an e-learning platform than the traditional paper-book (Benta at al., 2014). Furthermore, students’ success rates are also significantly higher for multimedia-based e-learning homework than traditional paper-based homework (Kodippili et al., 2007). 

##### students might appreciate e-learning (technology)
A 2017 study also expects improvements in communication technology (such as higher internet speed at accessible prices) to likely increase the use of multimedia in education [4]. There are already numerous studies which show that students are highly motivated to use new technology. For example, students in Ethiopia were given tablets through the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) scheme, but without any instructors or teachers. They taught themselves how to use the tablets, and even after several months, the students were still heavily engaged in using and recharging them [3]. This shows the curiosity that age group naturally possesses for interacting with new technology, which can be further extended to inclination towards digital means of education.
