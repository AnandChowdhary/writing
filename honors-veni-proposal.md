## Research Proposal

### 2a1, 2a2, and 2a3. Description of the proposed research

#### 2a1. Overall aim and key objectives, including:
- scientific relevance and challenges;
- originality and innovative character; 
- methods and techniques.

##### mini-summary of RQ and approach and expected outcome
In the proposed research, the question asked is: “Does implementing an e-learning solution with data-driven engagement features for homework and practice alongside the classroom increase student grades in secondary education?” For this, a web and app-based platform will be developed and studied to compare results with not having the platform, and each sub-question of this research aims to achieve a proof-of-concept feature in said platform. We aim to improve the homework experience for students, which in turn will increase their performance.

##### motivation: importance, and problematization, of homework
It has been shown that homework plays a critical, long-term role in the development of student’s achievement motivation and gives them time and experience to develop positive beliefs about achievement. It also teaches them strategies for coping with mistakes, difficulties, and setbacks (Bempechat, 2010). Research conducted in the United States since 1987 also shows that there is generally consistent evidence for a positive influence of homework on a student’s achievement (Cooper et al., 2006). However, the problem of homework completion  has been evidenced by existing grade and homework reports and teacher and student surveys (Renee at al., 1997). The problem aimed to solve that students are not motivated to go home and revise what is being taught in the classroom. This can result in test fatigue when preparing large amounts of content in a short period of time, and also adds pressure and stress in students’ lives.

##### e-learning (and gamification?) has been shown to be helpful in various aspects of learning improvement in general
The problem can be solved by implementing an e-learning solution which can be motivating and engaging for students, so that students practice what they learned in class every day for higher retention and better grades. Many studies have also shown that that effective use of e-learning could help increase student motivation engagement, and attendance. It should also increase student class participation, and improved behavior and performance on core subjects. Students have been proved to be more receptive and willing to solve more complex homework in an e-learning platform than the traditional paper-book (Benta at al., 2014). Furthermore, students’ success rates are also significantly higher for multimedia-based e-learning homework than traditional paper-based homework (Kodippili et al., 2007). 

##### students might appreciate e-learning (technology)
A 2017 study also expects improvements in communication technology (such as higher internet speed at accessible prices) to likely increase the use of multimedia in education. There are already numerous studies which show that students are highly motivated to use new technology. For example, students in Ethiopia were given tablets through the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) scheme, but without any instructors or teachers. They taught themselves how to use the tablets, and even after several months, the students were still heavily engaged in using and recharging them (Talbot, 2012). This shows the curiosity that age group naturally possesses for interacting with new technology, which can be further extended to inclination towards digital means of education.

##### (such e-learning must always be complementary with classroom work)
Therefore, several companies like Byju’s and not-for-profit organizations like Khan Academy are building e-learning platforms which can serve as completed alternatives to classroom learning. However, such a system has its own challenges. For one, it cannot teach students social skills, so there will always be a place where working adults send their kids to be socialized. Furthermore, it cannot offer personalized feedback to students, or even real-time feedback. Therefore, a good e-learning solution with not aim to replace the traditional classroom, but rather complement it with its set of additional strengths.

##### gap between teacher and technology
Although it has been established that students are comfortable with a digital means of education, there might be a gap of awareness between some students and their teachers about technology in general. A 2017 study asks the question “are online instructors ready to meet the 21st century challenges brought by this generation’s demand for the use of technology in education?”. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the average age of a primary school teacher in the Netherlands is 43, which is much younger than that in Italy (50), but would still require an effort from the teacher's end to implement such a solution. A 2017 study from the British University in Egypt also found that e-learning success in depends largely on the effectiveness of delivery and adequate training of instructors. Inadequately trained staff can become an obstacle in a finely-balanced learning process and can lead to problems in application use and in the perception of students.

##### yet, e-learning tech could also offer benefits to teachers
That being said, tools such as analytics of data generated by student usage will not only help teachers make better in-classroom decisions, but also make them more acquainted with homework process and results. Using a digital e-learning platform is also a preferred way for class management and avoids potential errors (Benta at al., 2014).

##### problem statement

Although the aforementioned studies show that e-learning has potential benefits for students and teachers, there is still a gap in the knowledge:
- These studies are hardly about integration with homework and tend to focus on e-learning as an alternate to the traditional classroom
- These studies are usually conducted in a laboratory environment and have small test groups, We do not know well enough whether integrated elearning platform with all relevant features will in fact positively impact learning process and outcomes for real students in longer term practical setting. In the proposed research, the focus will be to realize the theoretical potential of these studies by conducting them in real classrooms and aggregating them through multiple schools in different locations and with diverse backgrounds (for example, both international private schools in Amsterdam and state-sponsored schools in Deurne will be considered).

In addition to these, there are also the pain points of teachers which — despite being addressed previously — have not been solved yet. In essence, the literature research and the features it establishes showcase an opportunity for a unique product, which is the motivation for this proposal.

##### objectives

Therefore, this research proposal aims to:

- Integrate what is already known about e-learning in general with a specific, homework use case
- Show that the platform contributes to learning in real practice by comparing standard test scores of a control group (students without access to the e-learning platform) and a treatment group (students with access to the platform without forcing them to use it), and to show that the latter scores higher than the former
- Show how each of the features in the platform individually contribute to this effect by testing features separately and in combination
- Take into consideration the pain points of teachers when implementing an e-learning solution, and investigate how this learning curve can be reduced; the platform designed in this research proposal aims to bridge the gap by empowering teachers with actionable analytics, along with an easy-to-use interface

##### method

A combination of literature research with surveys, interviews, and analytics will be used in this research, along with conducting research with a diverse set of students from different schools around the Netherlands. To show that the platform truly contributes to better learning, a controlled experiment will be conducted at the end of the study with students who previously scored approximately equal grades.

###### towards the design of the platform

For developing the platform, each feature will be assessed based on literature research and interviews. For example, interviews will be conducted with students to identify the distraction and motivational aspects of revising at home, and the results will be used to build a solution implemented in the platform (e.g., engagement through notifications).

###### experimental study to show effects

The design of this study with be factorial, i.e., the study will be divided into discrete levels (each feature of the platform) and the experimental units take on all possible combinations of these levels, which will measure student grades in each factorial unit. This will allow us to study the effect of each feature in the platform on the response variable (i.e., student performance), as well as the effects of interactions between features.


#### 2a2. Research plan, including:
- practical timetable/timeline over the grant period;
- local, national and international collaboration;
- work plan (in narrative form).

The study will be conducted over two years and will go through all the aforementioned methods and stages. In the first six months, a thorough literature research will be conducted which will help establish a list of features the platform will have. After that, a factorial study will be conducted over six months evaluating each feature individually and finding which combination works the best for students. The study will be conducted in multiple schools at the same time to get a more aggregated and general result, for which several partnerships with municipalities and educational instituted will be established. Therefore, the primary partners for this study will be the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science, and provinces whose students participate in the study.
