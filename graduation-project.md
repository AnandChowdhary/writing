# Virtual assistant for scheduling appointments over email

Creative Technology BScGraduation Project

Anand ChowdharyS1930702

## Introduction

Last year, over 100 billion emails were sent every day (Email Statistics Report, 2015-2019). A very common use case of sending emails in a work environment is to set up appointments for in-person or virtual meetings. However, several email exchanges are required in order to find a suitable time and place where all parties are available, and this back-and-forth calendar conflict resolution wastes 17 minutes per meeting on average (Mortensen, 2017). This can add up to a significant waste of time (over 100 hours per year), which can be otherwise used for productive work.

For some professionals, scheduling these meetings manually can feel like a “frustrating distraction from the things that matter” (J. Cranshaw et al., 2017) so much so that they hire assistants to help with the task. However, not everyone can afford full-time assistants and will therefore turn to software solutions. Intelligent virtual assistants over email built using machine learning can help by automating these scheduling messages. An AI assistant can access a user’s calendar and can find empty meeting slots based on the location of the user location and their scheduling preferences, and then send and respond to emails on their behalf.

The goal of this paper is to design and develop an AI-powered intelligent virtual assistant that automates the email scheduling process, and in turn give insight into the following research questions:

1. How do professionals currently schedule appointments over email, with or without scheduling software? If they don’t use scheduling software, why is that the case?
1. What are the tasks required in scheduling a meeting in an automated software?

Lastly, a significant part of this paper will focus on the methodology and results of a user experience research on the web interface of the assistant service, conducted over several weeks. The AI software and APIs will be developed using Node.js and TypeScript, and the progressive web application will be developed using a modern Vue.js + Nuxt.js technology stack.
