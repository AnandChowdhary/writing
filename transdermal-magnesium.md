# Notes from “Myth or Reality—Transdermal Magnesium \[1]”

> The effectiveness of oral magnesium supplementation for the treatment of magnesium deficiency is beyond controversy

> the absorptive capacity of healthy skin for substances from the outside is very limited. This becomes evident particularly in the limited application for topical drugs. To get through the skin, a substance must penetrate the epidermis or has to be absorbed by sweat glands or hair follicles

> In magnesium chloride solution, magnesium is present in ionized form and therefore not able to penetrate a lipophilic layer. In addition, the radius of the hydrated magnesium ion (86 pm) has been reported to be 400 times higher than its dehydrated form, leading to the assertion that it is almost impossible for magnesium ions to pass through biological membranes

> Therefore, cellular magnesium uptake is only being carried out by specific magnesium transporters and not by diffusion. However, since dead cells of the upper skin layer do not contain functional magnesium transporters, which have not yet been identified in detail, magnesium absorption may be possible only at the small area of sweat glands and hair follicles.

> In this single blind, parallel designed pilot study participants (n = 25 four participants dropped out, aged 34.3 ± 14.8 years, height 171.5 ± 11 cm, weight 75.9 ± 14 Kg) were randomly assigned to either a 56 mg/day magnesium cream (n = 11) or a placebo cream group (n = 10) for two weeks. Magnesium serum and 24 h urinary excretion were measured at baseline and at 14 days of the intervention.

> After the Mg2+ cream intervention there was a clinically relevant increase in serum magnesium (0.82 to 0.89 mmol/L, p = 0.29) that was not seen in the placebo group (n = 10) (0.77 to 0.79 mmol/L), but this difference was only statistically significant (p = 0.02)) in a subgroup of non-athletes (n = 20).

> In the placebo group, both serum and urine concentrations showed no statistically significant change after the application of the placebo cream.

> Numerous studies demonstrate the effectiveness of oral therapeutic or preventive magnesium supplementation. Thus, an adequate magnesium supply is important for healthy pregnancy and lactation, as well as in patients with diabetes and prediabetes.

> Based on the current studies it is extremely alarming if a successful treatment of magnesium fails by propagation of transdermal magnesium, a scientifically not yet proven form of magnesium application. We suggest that future research should focus on a larger number of human subjects given higher concentrations of, for example, a magnesium cream application administered for longer durations to investigate whether transdermal application may show a significant contribution to improvement in magnesium status.

> However, we cannot yet recommend the application of transdermal magnesium.
