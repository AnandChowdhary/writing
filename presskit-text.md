## Shravan

Oswald Labs, Netherlands and India-based accessibility technology company, builds several products for people with disabilities. Their smartphone platform, Shravan, consists of apps and tools to make life easier. For example, Visib11y is an app for the visually impaired which uses deep-learning based computer vision to describe to users what's around them. Partially or completely blind users can use it with only vibrations and speech. They also make Live Subtitles, a captioning app for people with hearing impairment or deafness, and multiple reading apps for people with learning disorders like dyslexia. In 2019, Oswald Labs published a study with Augmenta11y, their reading app for students with dyselxia, and showed that it increases reading speeds by over 20%. Overall, thousands of people with disabilities use Oswald Labs' products every month.
