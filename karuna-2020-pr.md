## How Delhi startups came together to feed over 10,000 people during the COVID-19 lockdown

With the recent lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, thousands of daily wage workers in the informal sector are cut off from their income source. Startups, especially tech startups, will come through relatively unaffected as most knowledge workers have the option to work remotely, but this is not the case for the 450 million Indians working in the informal sector.

For example, Uber has set up the Uber Driver Care Fund to help take care of the immediate needs of Uber drivers and their families. Uber has invested ₹25 crore and raised over ₹5 crore from donors for their fund. Similarly, Swiggy has raised over ₹8 crore from their _Hope, Not Hunger_ campaign to distribute over 1 lakh cooked meals per day, and Zomato’s nonprofit Feeding India has raised over ₹25 crore to distribute meal kits across the country.

Early-stage startups in Delhi are not far behind, with the **[Karuna 2020](https://karuna2020.org)** nonprofit campaign co-founded by a group of startups, corporates, and NGOs to help sustain those most affected in Delhi–NCR. The campaign has already raised over ₹16 lakh and distributed over 2,000 dry ration packs that can help feed a family of 4–5 for one month. Each dry ration pack contains 10 kg rice, 2 kg dal, 1 kg salt, 1 L mustard oil, 4 soap bars, and 100 g Indian spices.

Oswald Labs, a noted accessibility technology company in the Delhi startup ecosystem, is one of the partner startups that founded Karuna 2020. Co-founder and CEO Anand Chowdhary, who was in the Forbes 30 Under 30 list for social entrepreneurship, said “Tens of thousands of daily wage earners like waste pickers, migrant workers, and laborers will go to sleep not knowing how to feed their families the next morning. Karuna 2020 is us — the startup ecosystem — doing our part.” Other notable organizations part of Karuna 2020 are Shakti Foundation, Unifiers, Krim Labs, Integral Livelihood and Social Entrepreneurship Foundation, and the Society for Awareness and Nature's Development.

What sets Karuna 2020 apart is how they are leveraging the open source ecosystem, as you would expect from tech startups. Karuna 2020’s Open Data APIs provide all information about the campaign and its impact, including list of donors, locations of distributions, and photos of beneficiaries. They have also built tools such as an 80G invoice generator, several open source guidelines, an automated website and social media update workflow, etc., that are all available for free on [GitHub](https://github.com/Karuna2020).

“We’ve ensured that all our work is open source, so that other nonprofits don’t have to waste time reinventing the wheel, and can easily build on top of our code and guides.” said Shivek Khurana, Karuna 2020 volunteer and founder of enterprise tech consultancy Krim Labs. Karuna 2020’s guides are documented processes for donation management, volunteer onboarding, designing, and more, all licensed under Creative Commons, that can be easily adopted by NGOs.

If you’re in a position to help those most affected by the COVID-19 lockdown, we encourage you to contribute to Karuna 2020 generously by going to their website, karuna2020.org/donate. They accept donations via UPI or bank transfer, and ensure 100% transparency and accountability, and also issue 80G tax exempt receipts. It’s the best way to give back to people we rely on every day, like waste pickers and laborers.

## Twenties something techpreneurs came together to feed over 10,000 people

In the current lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most tech start-ups are relatively unaffected as most have shifted to the Work From Home (WFH) option.

However this is not the case with the 450 million Indians working in the informal sector.

Many tech-startups realise their privilege and have pitched in to help.

Uber has set up the Uber Driver Care Fund to help take care of the immediate needs of Uber drivers and their families. They have invested ₹25 crore and raised over ₹5 crore from donors for their fund.

Similarly, Swiggy has raised over Rs 8 crore from their Hope, Not Hunger campaign to distribute over 1 lakh cooked meals per day, and Zomato’s nonprofit Feeding India has raised over Rs 25 crore to distribute meal kits across the country.

But early stage start-ups too are not far behind. Take the Karuna 2020 campaign for example. Started on the day of the lockdown, this campaign has raised Rs16 lakh and distributed over 2,000 dry ration packs that can help feed a family of 4–5 for one month. Each dry ration pack contains 10 kg rice, 2 kg dal, 1 kg salt, 1 L mustard oil, 4 soap bars, and 100 g Indian spices.

“If you work from home (like I do), chances are you'll come out of this pandemic nearly unaffected. However, tens of thousands of daily wage earners like waste pickers and laborers will go to sleep not knowing how to feed their families the next morning. Karuna 2020 is us — the startup ecosystem — doing our part,” says twenty-two year old Anand Chowdhary, CEO of Oswald Labs and a Karuna 2020 volunteer.

What sets Karuna 2020 apart is how they are leveraging the open source ecosystem, as you would expect from tech startups. Karuna 2020’s Open Data APIs provide all information about the campaign and its impact, including list of donors, locations of distributions, and photos of beneficiaries. They have also built tools such as an 80G invoice generator, several open source guidelines, an automated website and social media update workflow, etc., that are all available for free on[ GitHub](https://github.com/Karuna2020).

“We’ve ensured that all our work is open source, so that other nonprofits don’t have to waste time reinventing the wheel, and can easily build on top of our code and guides.” says Shivek Khurana, the founder of enterprise tech consultancy firm, Krim Labs and another Karuna 2020 volunteer. .

Karuna 2020’s guides are documented processes for donation management, volunteer onboarding, designing, and more, all licensed under Creative Commons, that can be easily adopted by NGOs.

They are now 23 volunteers many of whom are acquainted only online. They go live at 4 pm everyday and decide the next day’s activities. To begin with, they raised funds from their own circle of friends and family and their friends. But as the lockdown has been extended, even their first round recipients like the waste pickers colony in Vasant Kunj have run out of rations. As people have got to know them, they are getting more enquiries for rations. 

Their volunteers are now on a wider fund raising campaign. If you’re in a position to help those most affected by the COVID-19 lockdown, we encourage you to contribute to Karuna 2020 generously by going to their website, karuna2020.org/donate. They accept donations via UPI or bank transfer, and ensure 100% transparency and accountability, and also issue 80G tax exempt receipts. It’s the best way to give back to people we rely on every day, like waste pickers and labourers.
