CATEGORY
Which category best applies to your company?


PROGRESS
How far along are you?
How long have each of you been working on this? How much of that has been full-time? Please explain.
Are people using your product?

Do you have revenue?

If you've applied previously with the same idea, how much progress have you made since the last time you applied? Anything change?
If you have already participated or committed to participate in an incubator, "accelerator" or "pre-accelerator" program, please tell us about it.

IDEA
Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you're making?
What's new about what you're making? What substitutes do people resort to because it doesn't exist yet (or they don't know about it)?
Who are your competitors, and who might become competitors? Who do you fear most?
What do you understand about your business that other companies in it just don't get?
How do or will you make money? How much could you make?
(We realize you can't know precisely, but give your best estimate.)

How will you get users? If your idea is the type that faces a chicken-and-egg problem in the sense that it won't be attractive to users till it has a lot of users (e.g. a marketplace, a dating site, an ad network), how will you overcome that?

EQUITY
Have you incorporated, or formed any legal entity (like an LLC) yet?

Have you taken any investment yet?

If you have not formed the company yet, describe the planned equity ownership breakdown among the founders, employees and any other proposed stockholders. If there are multiple founders, be sure to give the proposed equity ownership of each founder.
(This question is as much for you as us.)

Please provide any other relevant information about the structure or formation of the company.

LEGAL
Are any of the founders covered by noncompetes or intellectual property agreements that overlap with your project? If so, please explain.
Who writes code, or does other technical work on your product? Was any of it done by a non-founder? Please explain.
Is there anything else we should know about your company?
(Pending lawsuits, cofounders who have left, etc.)


OTHERS
If you had any other ideas you considered applying with, please list them. One may be something we've been waiting for. Often when we fund people it's to do something they list here and not in the main application.
Please tell us something surprising or amusing that one of you has discovered.
(The answer need not be related to your project.)
