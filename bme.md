### Physiology

#### Homeostasis

Maintaining relatively constant physical and chemical conditions of the internal environment, though there are changes in the external environment. Consists of:

- **Receptor** senses an environmental change or stimuli
- **Control center** processes information supplied by receptor and generates a response (command)
- **Effector** is an organ or cell that responds to the command of control center.

A variation outside the desired range triggers an automatic response to correct the situation, i.e., negative feedback.

Types of chemical regulation:

| Type | Response time | Acts | Lasts |
| - | - | - | - |
| Hormonal (hormone or active chemical substance in blood/tissue) | Slow | Extensively | Long time |
| Nervous (body functions controlled by nervous system) | Fast | Exactly or locally | Short time |

#### Body fluids

| Type | Fluid location | Fluid volume | Cation |
| - | - | - | - |
| Extracellular fluid (ECF)  | Inside cells | 33% | Lot of Na+ |
| Intracellular fluid (ICF) | Outside cells | 57% | Lot of K+ |

#### Cell physiology

Movement of molecules and ions across a membrane; membranes are selectively permeable with a separation of charge across them:

| Type | Direction | Metabolic energy |
| - | - | - |
| Diffusion  | High → low concentration | Not required |
| Active transport | Low → high concentration | Requires ATP + carrier proteins |

##### Simple diffusion

- Non-carrier mediated transport
- Powered by thermal energy of diffusing molecules
- Stops when equal concentration
- Speed depends on:
  - Magnitude of concentration
	- Permeability of the membrane (shape and size)
	- Temperature (higher ⇒ faster)
	- Surface area

##### Active transport

- Na+ – K+ pump
- Energy dependent since moves against concentration gradient
- Steep gradient ⇒ involvement in electrochemical impulses

##### Resting potential

- V<sub>mem</sub> is caused by Na+ – K+ pump; Na+ is pumped outside (and K+ inside) the cell
- This creates Diffusion (due to Δ concentration) and Drift/migration (due to Δ charge)
- Concentration difference of charge creates potential difference, i.e.,  V<sub>mem</sub> = V<sub>ICF</sub> – V<sub>ECF</sub>
- Nerst's Equation calculates voltage difference across membrane V<sub>ion</sub> = (RT/zF) log (\[C]<sub>o</sub>/\[C]<sub>i</sub>) ≈ 61 log (\[C]<sub>o</sub>/\[C]<sub>i</sub>)
- V<sub>mem, rest</sub> for all cells is between –85 and –60 mV
- Only few (nerve, muscle) cells have the ability to  use and alter the membrane potential to initiate and propagate electrical signals

#### Neurons

Parts of a nerve cell or neuron:

- Nucleus
- Dendrites (docking stations for incoming signals from other neurons, look like branches)
- Axon (outgoing highway to send electrical signal, can be connected to other neurons or muscles, looks like a wire of Schwann cells, can be up to 1 meter)

V<sub>mem</sub> can change due to:

- Other neurons sending signals to dendrites
- Changes from inside the cell altering K+ and Na+ concentrations
