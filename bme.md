### Physiology

#### Homeostasis

Maintaining relatively constant physical and chemical conditions of the internal environment, though there are changes in the external environment. Consists of:

- **Receptor** senses an environmental change or stimuli
- **Control center** processes information supplied by receptor and generates a response (command)
- **Effector** is an organ or cell that responds to the command of control center.

A variation outside the desired range triggers an automatic response to correct the situation, i.e., negative feedback.

Types of chemical regulation:

| Type | Response time | Acts | Lasts |
| - | - | - | - |
| Hormonal (hormone or active chemical substance in blood/tissue) | Slow | Extensively | Long time |
| Nervous (body functions controlled by nervous system) | Fast | Exactly or locally | Short time |

#### Body fluids

| Type | Fluid location | Fluid volume | Cation |
| - | - | - | - |
| Extracellular fluid (ECF)  | Inside cells | 33% | Lot of Na+ |
| Intracellular fluid (ICF) | Outside cells | 57% | Lot of K+ |
