# Scheduling Assistants - Literature Research

## Introduction

Last year, 124 billion business emails and 110 billion consumer emails were sent per day (Email Statistics Report, 2015-2019). A very common use case of sending emails to colleagues is to set up appointments for in-person or virtual meetings. However, several email exchanges are required in order to find a suitable time and place where all parties are available. Almost 1 in 5 users struggle with finding sufficient available time slots (GetApp Lab, 2018), and this back-and-forth calendar conflict resolution wastes on average 17 minutes per meeting (Mortensen, 2017). Furthermore, over 3 in 5 meetings end up getting rescheduled for a different time or place (Mortensen, 2018), which wastes additional time in confirmations.

According to the European Commission (2017), the average Dutch small or medium-sized enterprise employs 3.2 people. Assuming that each employee attends 8 meetings per week, 30 otherwise productive hours are wasted. This costs the company over €500 per month in lost time, based on the average wage of €17.6 per hour (Centraal Planbureau, 2020). This adds up to over €2.5 billion per year for the small and medium-sized enterprise industry as a whole, and the numbers are even greater for larger enterprises.

For some professionals, scheduling these meetings manually can feel like a “frustrating distraction from the things that matter” (J. Cranshaw et al., 2017) so much so that they hire assistants to help with the task. However, not everyone can afford full-time assistants and will therefore turn to software solutions. Intelligent virtual assistants over email built using machine learning can help by automating these scheduling messages. An AI assistant can access a user’s calendar and can find empty meeting slots based on the location of the user location and their scheduling preferences, and then send and respond to emails on their behalf.

The goal of this literature research paper is to explore how professions schedule appointments in a work environment to make a case for the feasibility of an AI-powered scheduling assistant by giving insight into the following questions:

1. How do professionals currently schedule appointments over email, with or without scheduling software?
2. What are the key features that current scheduling software lack that make them undesirable for many of the use cases that professionals today require?
3. What are the tasks required in scheduling a meeting by automated software?

## Discussion

### Professionals scheduling appointments


### Key features that current scheduling software lack

There are several calendaring software products available to consumers, both commercial and open source. In general, they offer a range of features, including calendar views, built-in address book, appointment reminders, and email integration (imanuel, 2020). Many major internet companies offer calendaring solutions, such as Google Calendar, Microsoft Outlook, Apple Calendar, and Mozilla Thunderbird. For large, company-wide adoption, enterprise software such as Microsoft Exchange and IBM Notes are also available.

As noted in the previous section, some professionals hire assistants to manage their schedules, who in turn use one of these calendaring softwares, while others choose to do so themselves. In both cases, these systems leave the task of choosing a meeting time up to the user, but are fairly helpful in sending out invitations and reminders. Therefore, these softwares avoid the need to actively reason about constraints and the user’s scheduling preferences, such as which one of the many available meeting times to choose when underconstrained, and how the user would prefer to relax a meeting request when overconstrained (Berry et al., 2011). In a work environment, there are further decisions to make, such as which room is best for a given type of meeting, or setting up remote meetings using video calling software, which are passed onto the user.

There is no “one size fits all” solution to calendaring, because there is a wide variation in people’s meeting needs. For example, a professor who wants to schedule office hours with students might want students to pick their preferred meeting times, whereas a corporate executive might want to heavily control their availability times and response to meeting requests. Moreover, currently available calendaring tools are “particularly cumbersome when attendees need to coordinate multiple schedules while each using their own individual tool and approach” (J. Cranshaw et al., 2017).

Consequently, users end up using email for scheduling, despite the large number of scheduling tools available. A survey of workers in the field of information management found that over 80% of the respondents use email for scheduling (Ducheneaut and Bellotti, 2001).
